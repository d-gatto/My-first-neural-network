# My-first-neural-network
This is a Machine Learning demo. The aim of the project is to learn how to distinguish wether a certain data point has been generated by a sine function or not. I am using a fully connected 5-3-1 architecture trained with Bernoulli maximum likelihood batch gradient descent. The code is still incomplete and has not been debugged or tested yet.
